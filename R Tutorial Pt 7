-- While Loops in R --
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is TRUE such as:
#Printing i as long as i is less than 6
i <- 1
while ( i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}                  # this outputs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# The 'break' statement in a while loop stops the loop even if the condition is TRUE such as:
i <- 1
while(i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
  if (i == 4) {
    break
  }
}                  # this loop will stop at 3 because we have chosen to finish the loop by using the break statement when i is equal to i == 4

# With the 'next' statement, we can skip an iteration without terminating the loop such as:
i <- 0
while (i < 6) {
  i <- i + 1
  if (i == 3) {
    next
  }
print(i)
}            # when this loop passes the value 3, it will skip it and continue the loop


# If...Else combined with a While Loop, portrayed with Yahtzee!

dice <- 1
while(dice <= 6) {
  if (dice < 6) {
    print("No Yahtzee!")
  } else {
  print("Yahtzee!")
  }
  dice <- dice + 1
}                    # if this loop passes the values ranging from 1 to 5, it prints "No Yahtzee!", if it passes the value of 6 it prints "Yahtzee!"
