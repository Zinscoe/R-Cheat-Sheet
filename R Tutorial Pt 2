-- Concatenating Elements in R --
# In order to join two or more elements in R you have to use the paste() function.
# To combine both text and a variable, R uses a comma (,) such as the following example:
text <- "awesome"
paste("R is", text)

# In which this will output 'R is awesome'

# You can also use the comma(,) to add a variable to another variable such as:
text1 <- "R is"
text2 <- "awesome"
paste(text1, text2)

# Which will output the following
"R is awesome"

# For numbers, the + sign works as a mathematical operator like the following:
num1 <- 5
num2 <- 5

num1 + num2

# Which will output the following
10

# Unfortunately if you try to combine a string(text) and a number, R will give an error such as
num <- 5
text <-"Some text"

num + text
(Error in num + text : non-numeric argument to binary operator)

-- Multiple Variables in R --
# R allows Users to assign the same value to multiple variables with one line such as:
var1 <- var2 <- var3 <- "Orange"

# Print variable values
var1  # Outputs "Orange"
var2  # Outputs "Orange"
var3  # Outputs "Orange"

-- Variable Name Rules --
# Variables can have short names (like 'x' and 'y') or a more descriptive name like 'age' and 'carname') Rules for R variables are as follows:
# - Variable names must start with a letter and be ce combination of letters, digits, and a period(.)
# - Variable names cannot start with a number or underscore (_)
# - Variable names are case sensitive( age, AGE, Age are all three different variable names)
# - Reserverd words cannot be used like (TRUE, FALSE, NULL, IF,...)

-- Basic Data Types in R --
# R has many data types such as the following:
# - numeric (10.5, 55, 787)
# - integer (1L, 55L, 100L, the 'L' declares this value as an integer)
# - complex (9 + 3i, the 'i' is the imaginary part)
# - character (a.k.a string, such as "k", "R is exciting", "FALSE", "11.5")
# - logical (a.k.a boolean, such as RUE or FALSE)

# Can also use the class() function to check the data type of a variable such as the following examples:

# numeric
x <- 10.5
class(x)  # outputs numeric

# integer
x <- 1000L
class(x)  # outputs integer

# complex
x <- 9i + 3
class(x)  # outputs complex

# character/string
x <- "R is exciting"
class(x)  # outputs character

# logical/boolean
x <- TRUE
class(x)  # outputs logical
