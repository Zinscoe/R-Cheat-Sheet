-- Booleans / Logical Values in R --
# When you compare two values in R, the expression is evaluated and R returns the logical answer of TRUE or FALSE.
10 > 9  # outputs TRUE
10 == 9  # outputs FALSE
10 < 9  # outputs FALSE

# You can also compare two variables
a <- 10
b <- 9

a > b  # outputs TRUE

# You can also run a condition of an if statement, such as:
a <- 200
b <- 33

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
} else {
  print("b is not greater than a")
}                                        # outputs "b is not greater than a"

-- Operators in R --

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

# Arithmetic Operators are used to perform common mathematical operations such as:
+, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%

# Assignment Operators are used to assign values to variables
myvar <- 3
myvar <<- 3
3 -> myvar
3 ->> myvar

# And these are used interchangeably
# <<- is also a global assigner.

# Comparison operators are used to compare two values such as:
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# Logical Operators are used to combine condition statements such as:
&, &&, |, ||, !

# Miscellaneous Operators are used to manipulate data such as:
  : # this creates a series of numbers in a sequence such as:
    x <- 1:10
  %in% # Finds out if an element belongs to a vector such as:
    x %in% y
  %*% # is Matrix duplication such as
    x <- Matrix1 %*% Matrix2
