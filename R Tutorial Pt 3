-- Numbers in R --
# There are three number types in R:
# - numeric
# - integer
# - complex

x <- 10.5 # numeric
y <- 10L # integer
z <- 1i # complex

# Numeric data types are the most common in R, and it contans any number with out without a decimal.
x <- 5.5
y <- 1010110101
z <- 3.14

# Integers are numeric data without decimals. Integers are used when you are certain that you will never
# create a variable that should contain decimals. And to create an integer variable, we must use the "L"
# after the integer variable
x <- 10L
y <- 14L
z <- 105054L

# Complex numbers are written with an "i" as the imaginary part:
x <- 3i + 5
y <- 5i

-- Data Type Conversions in R --
# You can convert data types from one to another with these functions:
# - as.numeric()
# - as.integer()
# - as.complex()

# Examples of Type Conversions
x <- 1L # assign a variable with an integer
y <- 2 # assign a variable as a numeric

# convert integer to numeric
a <- as.numeric(x)

# convert numeric to integer
b <- as.integer(y)

# then we print the values of x and y
x  # prints 1
y  # prints 2

# print the class names of a and b
class(a)  # prints 'numeric'
class(b) # prints 'integer'

-- Math in R --
# In R, you can use operators to perform common mathematical operations on numbers, such as '5 + 5' or '5 - 5'

# R also has many built-in math functions that allows User to perform mathematical tasks with numbers.

# min() finds the lowest number in a set
min(5, 10, 12, 24) # outputs 5

# max() finds the highest number in a set
max(5, 10, 25, 13) # outputs 25

# sqrt() function returns the square root of a number
sqrt(16) # outputs 4

# abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of a number
abs(-4.7) #outputs 4.7

# ceiling() function rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and floor() function rounds downward to its nearest integer
ceiling(1.4) # outputs 2
floor(1.4) # outputs 1
