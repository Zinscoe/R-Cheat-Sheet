-- Comments in R --
# This is a comment in R

# This is a
# multi line comment in R 

-- Syntax in R --
# This outputs text in R
"Hello World!"

# You can use single or double quotes in R
'Hello World!'

# To output numbers in R, just type the number without quotes
5
6
7

-- Calculations in R --
# To do calculations, just calculate the numbers together
5 + 5
5 - 5

-- Another output option for R --
# R has a print() function that's available to use if you're used to Python that also uses a print() function to output code
print("Hello World!")    # This prints Hello World! to the console

for (x in 1:10) {     # This will print out
  print(x)            # 1 - 10 due to the for loop
}

-- Variables in R --
# Variables are containers for storing data values

# Variables are created the moment you assign a value to it
# And to assign a variable you use the '<-' sign
# Such as
myName <- 'Zach'
age <- 32

# And to call the variable or output the variable you can do these two things
myName
# or
print(myName)

# In which both will print 'Zach'

-- KEEP IN MIND WITH PRINT() FUNCTION --
# There are times you have to use the print() function to output code, like when using for loops such as
for (x in 1:10) {
  print(x)
}
