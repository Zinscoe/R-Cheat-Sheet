-- If...Else Statements in R --
# R supports the usual logical operators from mathematics such as:
==, !=, >, >=, <, <=

# The if statement is written with the 'if' keyword, and it is used to specify a block of code to be executed
# if a condition is TRUE such as:
a <- 33
b <- 200

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
}                                  # outputs 'b is greater than a'

# The Else if keyword is a way of saying "if the previous conditions weren't true, try this condition" such as:
a <- 33
b <- 33

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
} else if (a == b) {
  print("a and b are equal")
}                                # this outputs "a and b are equal"

# The Else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the conditions before it such as:
a <- 200
b <- 33

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
} else if (a == b) {
  print("a and b are equal")
} else {
  print("a is greater than b")
}                                # this outputs 'a is greater than b'

-- Nested If Statements in R --

# You can have if statements inside if statements called nested if statements as well such as:
x <- 41

if (x > 10) {
  print("Above ten")
  if (x > 20) {
    print("and also above 20!")
  } else {
    print("but not above 20.")
  }
  else {
    print("below 10.")
}                            # which this will ouput 'Above ten and also above 20!'

  -- AND OR Operators in R --
  # The &(AND) symbol is a logical operator and is used to combine conditional statements such as:
  a <- 200
  b <- 33
  c <- 500

  if (a > b & c > a) {
    print("Both conditions are true")
  }

  # The |(OR) symbol is a logical operator and is used to combine conditional statements such as:
  a <- 200
  b <- 33
  c <- 500

  if (a > b | a > c) {
    print("At least one of the conditions is true")
  }
