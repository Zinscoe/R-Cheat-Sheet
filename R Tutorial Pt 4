-- Strings in R --
# Strings are used for storing text
# Strings are also surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks such as:
'string'
"string"

# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the '<-' operator after the variable and the string to follow
str <- "Hello"
str1 <- 'Hello'

str # prints "Hello"
str1 # prints 'Hello'

# You can also assign a multiline string to a variable like this:
str <- "This string is,
so very long,
that I have to add commas,
to make it a multiline string."

str # prints the value of the str variable above

# If you want the line breaks to be inserted at the same position as in the value of the variable, use the cat() function:
cat(str)

# There are many string functions in R. Such as the following.

# To find the number of characters in a string, use the nchar() function:
str <- "Hello World!"

nchar(str) # outputs 12

# Check if a character or a sequence of  of characters are present in a string with the grepl() function:
str <- "Hello World!"

grepl("H", str)  # outputs TRUE
grepl("Hello", str)  # outputs TRUE
grepl("X", str)  # outputs FALSE

# Using the paste() function we can merge/concatenate two strings:
str <- "Hello"
str1 <- "World"

paste(str, str1)  # outputs "Hello World"

-- Escape Characters in R --
# To insert characters that are illegal in strings, you must use an escape character.
# An escape character is a backslash '\' followed by the character you want to insert.

str <- "We are the so-called "Vikings", from the north."

str  # this will output an error due to an unexpected symbol in "str <- "We are the so-called "Vikings"
# In order to fix this issue above, we have to add an escape character '\' in front of the double quotes for Vikings such as:
str <- "We are the so-called \"Vikings\", from the north."

str  # this will output the value of the str variable, including the escape characters
cat(str)   # this will output the value of the str variable without the escape characters

# Other escape characters in R:
\\ -- Result
\n -- New Line
\r -- Carriage Return
\t -- Ttab
\b -- Backspace
